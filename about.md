I'm Joe Shields, a maker-type person from Portland, Oregon.
If you're looking for technical/professional things, checkout [my github.io
page.](https://joedang.github.io/)
This blog is mostly an open journal about... whatever I feel like. 

You're in the right place if you like:  
- rockets and other space things,
- prototyping and rapid manufacturing,
- ramblings and musings,
- and hating on zoomer software paradigms.
