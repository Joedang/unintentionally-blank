- [ ] Get images working in the RSS feed.  
      Currently, they cut out the baseurl.
      I tried setting the xml:base property and putting atom.xml in posts/
      At some point, I had it working, and I'm not sure what changed.
    - [ ] It might be good to compare to Luke Smith's RSS feed, since his seems 
          to have a working icon.
- [ ] Get the favicon or full peanut image to show up as the icon for the feed.  
      Right now, it just shows up as the default icon, which is... okay I guess.
